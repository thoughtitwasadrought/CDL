# Open Source Search Engine
The project implements a inverted index search for a query in a set of documents.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for running the project besides Python3.

### Installing

All the libraries used are part of the Python standard, so you only need to
install Python3.
For installing Python3 on Ubuntu 18.04(although it should already be installed), run:
```
apt-get install python3
```
## Running the tests

The tests are not yet implemented, but a general expected case would be:
python3 testUnit.py <projectMainFile> which will run a number of different tests
that will try to cover as many corner cases as possible, afterwards displaying
which tests have failed, if any.
### Break down into end to end tests

## Deployment

There should be no aditional steps for deployment since the project is a
pretty standard Python file.
